Baking
======

Put cake to previously preheated oven and bake for ~40-50min.
Then move it out of mold to prevent getting wet during cooling perion.
**It tastes best just after cooling down!**

| Remember: Best before next day, so don't let it go pearshaped overnight.

No rasins were harmed during baking

Pro-Tip
-------
Excesive heating flamable matter can lead to flame!
Don't flame on me when you set your home on flame...
