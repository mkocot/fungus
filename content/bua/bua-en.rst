First stage (aka The Day Before)
================================
Required to get "active" sourdough

`TIP: Salt is slowing down process, never add it here`

#. Put few spoons of sourdough
#. Add 2 cups of rye flour
#. Mix-in some water (the dough shall be oozy, heavy and sludgy)
#. Leave it until next day

Again try to get that sweet, sweet, **sludgy** (but not damp) feeling and leave for (~7h) in room temperature, but **keep away** from windy and sunny places (like window). After that time you should check if it doubled it volume and started making funny noises like *Pshh* **Pshh!** *Plop*

`TIP: If you are not sure if bread is baked enough carefully take it from mold and knock with finger. When it's making sound like knocking wood the bread is ready!`

#. Take bread **OUT OF MOLDS** to prevent bread crust going wet.
#. Put it on grit or anything that will make leave space between botton and table. This will prevent wet bottom.
#. cover with pot cloth so it will not dry

|

The Consumption
===============

#. I know you want to devour it ASAP but hold your horses, my deer friend!
#. Wait until it's cold (aka room temperature) this will prevent excesive drying of bread.
#. Go and devour!

Have a nice dough!
